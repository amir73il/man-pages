Global changes
--------------

-  Build system:
   -  PDF book:
      -  Add support for UNIX V10 sources.
   -  Makefiles:
      -  Don't pass an escaped # to grep(1).  Use a trick to work with
         both new and old systems.  This fixes a regressions in the
         build system from man-pages-6.11, which was itself introduced
         while fixing a regression introduced in man-pages-6.10.
