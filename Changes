Global changes
--------------

-  Build system:
   -  [Breaking change!]
      Require the user to pass '-R' to make(1).  This is necessary to be
      able to do the following change.  When GNU make(1) releases a new
      version, it will not be necessary to pass -R, but in current
      versions of make(1) it is necessary.

   -  [Breaking change!]
      Use '?=' assignments instead of ':=', to support setting make(1)
      variables in the environment.  Now one can do this:

	$ export prefix=/usr
	$ make -R
	$ sudo make install -R

      (The -R is only necessary in GNU make(1) versions prior to the
       yet-unreleased 4.5.)

   -  Escape '#' in regexes, to support old versions of GNU make(1).
      This fixes a regression in man-pages-6.10, which caused issues in
      users with an old-enough version of GNU make(1), such as the one
      present in Debian old-old-stable.

   -  Fix duplicate overview-panel entries in the PDF book.

-  CONTRIBUTING.d/:
   -  Add C coding style guide.

-  RELEASE:
   -  Document the production of the book.

-  man/:
   -  Refresh bpf-helpers(7) from Linux v6.13.
